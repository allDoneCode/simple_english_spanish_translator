# simple_english_spanish_translator
A simple translator for english/spanish words.
I'm hoping to create an English/Spanish translator. It will probably start off with a few simple nouns and verbs, and only going from English to Spanish. But, hopefully I'll be able to translate it both ways eventually and also formulate proper grammer...
